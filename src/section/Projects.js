    const intro1= <p> Here's a glimpse at some of my personal projects:  </p>
    const project1par1 = <p> This is an application that allows parents and educators to create <strong>practice activites</strong> for pre/emergent readers. Children simply visit the homepage, select the activity and begin to practice. Authorized users can create new activities via the <strong>form</strong> and publish them on the homepage.</p>
    const project1par2 = <p> I built this project using <strong>React, Tailwindcss, Firebase, </strong> and <strong> AWS buckets</strong>. Some of the libraries I used include <strong>react-dnd, react-icons</strong> and <strong>react-confetti.</strong></p>
    const project1par3 = <p> In the future, I plan to implement libraries by authorized users, so that their entire collection will be grouped. I also plan to implment filters based on the following subjects like: <strong>math, reading, science</strong> and <strong>social studies</strong>. </p>
    
    const project2par1 = <p>This project is one that comes from the heart. It's one of the reasons I decided to become a programmer. While living in Costa Rica, I noticed that the education system didn't have programs that would teach kids to love reading. The only book educators would suggest was <strong>Paco y Lola</strong>, a book published in 1958. Kids simply learned how to read by reading printouts. During the pandemic, when parents were tasked with teaching kids how to read, many were at a loss, so I decided that I would build a Spanish reading app. </p>
    const project2par2 = <p> I began to build out this project as my capstone during Foundations. Right now, the application simply has the <strong>account creation, login,</strong> and <strong>avatar</strong> features. Once the avatar is created, it is placed on a map. Now, I'm tasked with building worlds for kids to enter -- with their avatar -- to complete simple tasks that will teach them how to read, and fall in love with reading along the way.</p>
    const project2par3 = <p>I built this project using <strong>vanilla JavaScrip, CSS,</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. I built all of my images using <strong>Figma</strong> and stored them in an <srong>s-3 AWS bucket</srong>. I used <strong>Firebase</strong> for my authentication and database. The avatar snapshot was created using <strong>HTML2canvas</strong>. While I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish early on, I plan to refactor this project using REACT as it will help me scale it in the future. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
